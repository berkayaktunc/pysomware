**Fernet** is a symmetric encryption using Cryptography module in Python. Cryptography is the practice of securing useful information while transmitting from one computer to another or storing data on a computer. Cryptography deals with the encryption of plaintext into ciphertext and decryption of ciphertext into plaintext. Python supports a cryptography package that helps us encrypt and decrypt data.

This is simple ransomware using Python. Need to modify **ransom.py** so that it can affect the whole system or just the file. **get_only_that_files()** effects only that file, but **get_all_files()** effects whole system. Just be careful while using and do not use illegally.
